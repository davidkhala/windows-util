# PowerShell

## Philosophy
- Don't over complicate things. Keep it simple and use the most straight forward way to accomplish a task. 
- Avoid aliases and positional parameters in any code that you reuse. Format your code for readability. 
- Don't hardcode values; use parameters and variables. 
- Don't write unnecessary code even if it doesn't hurt anything. It adds unnecessary complexity. Attention to detail goes a long way when writing any PowerShell code.
