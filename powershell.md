# PowerShell

## Philosophy
- Don't over complicate things. Keep it simple and use the most straight forward way to accomplish a task. 
- Avoid aliases and positional parameters in any code that you reuse. Format your code for readability. 
- Don't hardcode values; use parameters and variables. 
- Don't write unnecessary code even if it doesn't hurt anything. It adds unnecessary complexity. Attention to detail goes a long way when writing any PowerShell code.
- In PowerShell, there's a specific list of approved verbs. It's important to choose an approved verb in PowerShell when functions are added to a module. The module **generates a warning message at load time if you choose an unapproved verb**. That warning message makes your functions look unprofessional. Unapproved verbs also limit the discoverability of your functions.
